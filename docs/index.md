!!! Note
    As with any programming language it is more important to understand the
    logic and the vocabulary than to know everything by heart. First and
    foremost, know where to find answers:

    - [Introduction to Macro programming](https://imagej.net/scripting/macro)
    - [Macro language documentation](https://imagej.net/ij/developer/macro/macros.html)
    - [Huge list of all build-in functions](https://wsr.imagej.net/developer/macro/functions.html)
    - [Image.sc forum](https://image.sc)
    - [A great cheat sheet](https://www.biodip.de/w/images/0/00/ImageJ_macro_cheatsheet.pdf)

!!! Note
    All the scripts are available in
