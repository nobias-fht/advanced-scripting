# Advanced scripting with Fiji

In this course, we introduce the fundamentals of scripting in Fiji. It is the
support for a two-day course given at Human Technopole, the third day being
focused on personal projects. :open_book:

The course assumes familiarity with Fiji and no coding experience.

    foremost, know where to find answers:
