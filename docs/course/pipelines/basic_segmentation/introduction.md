#Basic Segmentation and Quantification

In this section, we are going to make a macro to do some basic segmentation and intenisty quantification on an image. We will do this on one image, but you can imaging using what we have learned to apply the pipeline to many images!

!!! info "Learning Objectives"
    * Learn how to deal with multi-channel images and multiple images
    * Learn how to apply a threshold to an image
    * Learn how to use Regions Of Interest (ROIs) in a script and perform quantifications
    * Learn how to incorporate funcions in your macro
