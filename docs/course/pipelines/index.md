# Pipelines

It is time to use everything we learned to do some actual analysis. Everything
so far was intended to give you some basics. But the best way to learn is to
actually do something. So let's put on our Bioimage Analyst hats! :tophat:

!!! info "Aim"
    We will try to build three pipelines:

    * Looping through files :loop:
    * Basic segmentation :collision:
    * Advanced segmentation :rocket:

We will gradually build up the pipelines and decrease the amount of guidance. :fire:

Make sure that you downloaded the [course datasets](https://download.fht.org/jug/advanced_scripting.zip)
and unzipped it into the folder of your choice.
