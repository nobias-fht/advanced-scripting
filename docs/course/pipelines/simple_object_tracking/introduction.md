#Simple Object Tracking and Measuring

Sometimes, we would like to track an object through an image stack. An example of this might be measuring the position of a cell over time. There are advanced ways of doing this, but for simple cases, sometimes it is enough to track an object manually (say, if we have few objects or short movies).

Here we will make a simple script to semi-automate this process, letting us track and object using the mouse and a key binding.
