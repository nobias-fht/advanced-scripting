# Simple Object Tracking and Measuring

Sometimes, we would like to track an object through an image stack. An example
of this might be measuring the position of a cell over time. :clock:

There are advanced ways of doing this, but for simple cases, it is sometimes
enough to track an object manually (say, if we have few objects or short movies).
:movie_camera:

Here we will make a simple script to semi-automate this process, letting us
track an object using the mouse and a key binding. :mouse:
