# Loop exercises

!!! question
    What is the problem with the following loops:

    ```javascript title="Some problematic loops"
    for (i=0; i>10; i++){
        print(i);
    }
    ```

    ```javascript title="Another problematic loop"
    for (i=0; i<10; i--){
        print(i);
    }
    ```

    And in this code snippet:

    ```javascript title="Some more problematic loops"
    for (i=0; i<5; i++){
        print(i);
    }

    j = 0;
    while (i<10){
        j += 2;
    }
    ```

    :warning: If you run them, you might have to kill your Fiji session.

    How could we count from 0 to 100, but in increments of 5?

!!! question
    Can we can count backward (e.g. from 10 to 0) using a for loop?

    Can you write a loop within a loop? What do you need to pay attention to?
