# Variable exercises

!!! question
    What happens when you use mathematical operations on strings? Try some
    and find out!

!!! question
    If you have the following variables:

    ```javascript title="Variable values"
    var1 = 5;
    var2 = 7;
    var3 = var1 == var2;
    ```

    What is the value of `var3`? What does `==` means? What happens if you
    replace `==` by `!=`?

    Where would you go to find out? :skull_and_crossbones:

Variables can be much more than a number or a sentence! It is time to
discover arrays. :mag_right:
