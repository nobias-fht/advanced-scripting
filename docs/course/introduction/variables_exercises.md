# Variable exercises

!!!Question
        What happens when you use mathematical operations on strings? Try some
        and find out!

!!!Question
        What happens if you try mathematical operations between
        strings and numbers?

!!!Question
        If you have the following variables:

        ```javascript title="Variable values"
        var1 = 5;
        var2 = 7;
        var3 = var1 == var2;
        ```

        What is the value of `var3`? What does `==` mean? Where would you go
        to find out? :skull_and_crossbones:

Variables can be much more than a number or a sentence! It is time to
discover arrays. :mag_right:
