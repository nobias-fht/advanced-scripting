# Array exercises

!!!Question
    Given an array consisting of the numbers between zero and ten. What are the
    second, fifth and eighth values in the array? How would you print them?

    ```javascript title="Print values from array"
         my_array = newArray(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10); //(1)!
    ```

    1. While this is a perfectly valid way of initializing array, it would be
    inefficient if we wanted to initialize an array of, say, 100 values. Look at
    the ImageJ macro docs and try to understand what the function
    `Array.getSequence()` does.

!!!Question
    It is a bit cumbersome to print an array element by element. Can't we
    print the whole array directly? Try using `Array.print()` rather than
    simply `print()`.

!!!Question
    Try initializing some arrays of various types. Can you mix types in
    an array?
