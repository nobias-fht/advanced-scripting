# Strings

 A `string` is a data type that can store any text you might want. We have already seen strings before, for example "Hello World", and we have stored strings as variables before, for instance when we stored the `string` "This is also a varibale" in the variable `message`:
 ```java
 message = "This is also a variable";
 ```

The ability to store and manipulate strings is a key part of `ImageJ Macro` programming, so let's take a close looks.

We can create a string in the same way we create any other variable, but picking a name and assigning a value to it. In the case of strings, the value must be enclosed in quotation marks `"`.

 ```java
 message = "This is a string";
 message = This is not a string
 ```
