# Installing Fiji

First thing first, let's install Fiji. :desert_island:

=== "From the website"

    1. Visit Fiji's [download page](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads)
    2. Download the archive for your OS
    3. Extract the content of the archive (`Fiji.app`)
    4. Place `Fiji.app` in your `Applications` folder (macOS) or in
    `C:\Users\[your name]\` (Windows)

=== "HT macOS"

    1. Open `HT self Service` app
    2. Search for `Fiji`
    3. Click on `install`

Now that we have Fiji installed, we are eager to start our first macro script.
We will start by creating a new macro. :dizzy:
