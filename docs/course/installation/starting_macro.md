# ImageJ Macros

!!!Question
    What is a "macro"? According to the
    [official guide](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/macros.html):

    "A macro is a simple program that automates a series of ImageJ commands."
    :robot:

Macros are developed in a small environment (that is a window) in Fiji that
allows running and debugging them. To create a new macro, simply click
on `Plugins > New > Macro`. :collision:

A new window should have opened. Are you ready to learn how to script like a
divine being revered by entire civilizations? :moai:
